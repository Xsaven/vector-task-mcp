<description>Comprehensive Brain.php initialization - scans project, analyzes docs/code, generates optimized configuration</description>
</meta>
<purpose>Discovers project context, analyzes docs/code, researches best practices, generates optimized .brain/node/Brain.php with project-specific guidelines, stores insights to vector memory</purpose>
<purpose>The InitBrain command automates smart distribution of project-specific configuration across Brain.php, Common.php, and Master.php based on project context discovery.</purpose>

# Iron Rules
## Temporal-context-first (CRITICAL)
Temporal context MUST be initialized first: Bash('date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z"')
- why: Ensures all research and recommendations reflect current year best practices
- on_violation: Missing temporal context leads to outdated recommendations

## Parallel-research (CRITICAL)
Execute independent research tasks in parallel for efficiency
- why: Maximizes throughput and minimizes total execution time
- on_violation: Sequential execution wastes time on independent tasks

## Evidence-based (CRITICAL)
All Brain.php guidelines must be backed by discovered project evidence
- why: Prevents generic configurations that do not match project reality
- on_violation: Speculation leads to misaligned Brain behavior

## Vector-memory-storage (HIGH)
Store all significant insights to vector memory with semantic tags
- why: Enables future context retrieval and knowledge accumulation
- on_violation: Knowledge loss and inability to leverage past discoveries

## Preserve-variation (CRITICAL)
NEVER modify or replace existing #[Includes()] attributes on Brain.php Brain already has a Variation (e.g., Scrutinizer) - preserve it Standard includes from vendor/jarvis-brain/core/src/Includes are OFF LIMITS
- why: Variations are pre-configured brain personalities with carefully tuned includes
- on_violation: Modifying Variation breaks brain coherence and predefined behavior

## Project-includes-only (CRITICAL)
Only analyze and suggest includes from .brain/node/Includes/ FORBIDDEN: vendor/jarvis-brain/core/src/Includes/* modifications FORBIDDEN: Replacing or adding standard includes to Brain.php
- why: Standard includes are managed by Variations, not by init process
- on_violation: Standard includes are bundled with Variation - do not duplicate or override

## Smart-distribution (CRITICAL)
Distribute project-specific rules across THREE files to avoid duplication: .brain/node/Common.php - Shared by Brain AND all Agents .brain/node/Master.php - Shared by ALL Agents only (NOT Brain) .brain/node/Brain.php - Brain-specific only
- why: Prevents duplication across components, ensures single source of truth for each rule type
- on_violation: Rule placed in wrong file causes duplication or missing context

## Distribution-categories (CRITICAL)
COMMON: Environment (Docker, CI/CD), project tech stack, universal coding standards, shared config MASTER: Agent execution patterns, tool usage constraints, agent-specific guidelines, task handling BRAIN: Orchestration rules, delegation strategies, Brain-specific policies, workflow coordination
- why: Clear categorization ensures each file serves its specific purpose without overlap
- on_violation: Miscategorized rule leads to missing context or unnecessary duplication

## Incremental-enhancement (CRITICAL)
ALWAYS analyze existing file content BEFORE enhancement If file has rules/guidelines - PRESERVE valuable existing, ADD only missing NEVER blindly overwrite populated files - merge intelligently Compare discovered patterns with existing config to find gaps
- why: Preserves manual customizations and avoids losing valuable existing configuration
- on_violation: Valuable existing configuration lost, manual work discarded

## Extract-to-env-variables (CRITICAL)
ALL configurable values in generated code MUST use $this->var("KEY", default) WORKFLOW per file generation (6a, 6b, 7):   1. READ existing .brain/.env to get current variables   2. GENERATE code using $this->var("KEY", default) for configurable values   3. APPEND new variables to .env with # description and # variants: comments Variable candidates: thresholds, limits, toggles, versions, paths, model names Each variable: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, sensible default, description, variants if applicable NEVER create empty/dummy variables - only those ACTUALLY USED in generated code
- why: Centralizes configuration, enables tuning without code changes, prevents magic values
- on_violation: Hardcoded values in code OR unused variables in .env

# Phase3 5 vector memory research

GOAL(Deep research of vector memory via specialized VectorMaster agents for each target file)

If project includes suggested:      brain make:include {name}    3. Test Brain behavior with sample tasks    4. After any modifications:      brain compile    5. Consider running:      /init-agents for agent generation      /init-vector for vector memory population)

# Error recovery
Comprehensive error handling for all failure scenarios
## Examples
- IF(no .docs/ found) → THEN → [Continue with codebase analysis only → Log: Documentation not available] → END-IF
- IF(tech stack detection fails) → THEN → [Use manual fallback detection → Analyze file extensions and structure] → END-IF
- IF(vector memory research fails) → THEN → [Continue with codebase-only discovery → Log: Vector memory unavailable] → END-IF
- IF(brain list:includes fails) → THEN → [Use hardcoded standard includes list → Log: Include discovery failed] → END-IF
- IF(Brain.php generation fails) → THEN → [Report detailed error with file:line → Provide manual fix guidance] → END-IF
- IF(brain compile fails) → THEN → [Analyze compilation errors → Provide fix suggestions] → END-IF
- IF(vector memory storage fails) → THEN → [Continue without storage → Log: Memory storage unavailable] → END-IF

# Quality gates
Validation checkpoints throughout initialization
## Examples
- Gate 1: Temporal context initialized (date, year, timestamp)
- Gate 2: Project discovery completed with valid tech stack
- Gate 3: Environment discovery completed (Docker, CI/CD, Dev Tools)
- Gate 4: At least one discovery task succeeded (docs OR codebase)
- Gate 5: Smart distribution categorization completed (Common/Master/Brain)
- Gate 6: All enhanced files written successfully
- Gate 7: All enhanced files pass PHP syntax validation
- Gate 8: Compilation completes without errors
- Gate 9: Compiled output exists at .claude/CLAUDE.md
- Gate 10: At least one insight stored to vector memory

# Example laravel docker project
SCENARIO(Laravel project with Docker, Sail, and comprehensive documentation)
## Examples
- Discovery: Laravel 11, PHP 8.3, MySQL, Redis, Queue, Sanctum
- Environment: Docker (Sail), GitHub Actions CI/CD, PHPStan L8
- Docs: 15 .md files with architecture, requirements, domain logic
- Vector Mining: 12 insights found, 8 validated for distribution
- SMART DISTRIBUTION:
-   Common.php: Docker/Sail environment rules, PHP 8.3 type constraints, MySQL conventions
-   Master.php: Service class patterns, repository usage, Pest test conventions
-   Brain.php: Agent delegation for Laravel domains (Auth, Queue, Cache)
- Result: All three files enhanced, Scrutinizer Variation preserved
- Insights: 8 architectural insights stored to vector memory

# Example node docker project
SCENARIO(Node.js/Express project with Docker and TypeScript)
## Examples
- Discovery: Node.js 20, Express, TypeScript, MongoDB
- Environment: Docker Compose, GitLab CI, ESLint + Prettier
- Docs: None found - codebase analysis only
- Vector Mining: 7 insights found, 5 validated for distribution
- SMART DISTRIBUTION:
-   Common.php: Docker network rules, Node 20 constraints, ESLint compliance
-   Master.php: TypeScript type generation, async/await patterns, Jest test structure
-   Brain.php: API route delegation strategy
- Result: All three files enhanced, Architect Variation preserved
- Insights: 5 tech stack insights stored

# Example hybrid microservices
SCENARIO(Hybrid PHP/JavaScript microservices with Kubernetes)
## Examples
- Discovery: Laravel API + React SPA + Docker + Kafka
- Environment: Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, PHPStan + ESLint
- Docs: ADRs, API specs, deployment docs, domain model
- Vector Mining: 18 insights found, 12 validated for distribution
- SMART DISTRIBUTION:
-   Common.php: K8s service discovery, cross-service authentication, Kafka topic naming
-   Master.php: Event schema validation, API contract testing, service boundary respect
-   Brain.php: Multi-service orchestration, cross-domain delegation, event saga coordination
- Project Includes: Suggested MicroserviceBoundaries.php, EventSchemas.php
- Result: All three files enhanced with microservice awareness
- Insights: 12 cross-cutting concerns stored
