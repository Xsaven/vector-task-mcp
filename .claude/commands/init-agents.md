# Iron Rules
## Mandatory-agentmaster-delegation (CRITICAL)
Brain MUST delegate ALL agent generation to AgentMaster. FORBIDDEN: Brain creating agents directly.
- why: Separation of orchestration (Brain) and execution (AgentMaster). Brain is NOT an executor.
- on_violation: ABORT. Delegate to AgentMaster immediately. Brain orchestrates, never executes.

## Project-agents-only (CRITICAL)
ONLY create PROJECT-SPECIFIC agents using Master variation FORBIDDEN: Creating or modifying SYSTEM agents (AgentMaster, PromptMaster, CommitMaster, etc.) FORBIDDEN: Modifying agents from vendor/jarvis-brain/core/src/ System agents use SystemMaster variation and are OFF LIMITS
- why: System agents are pre-configured via SystemMaster variation. Project agents use Master variation.
- on_violation: Skip system agent. Only create project-specific agents.

## Preserve-system-agents (CRITICAL)
System agents (ending with Master) are managed by SystemMaster variation Examples: AgentMaster, PromptMaster, CommitMaster, WebResearchMaster, ExploreMaster, DocumentationMaster, VectorMaster, ScriptMaster These agents are specialized for Brain orchestration - NEVER regenerate or modify them
- why: System agents have carefully tuned configurations for Brain ecosystem
- on_violation: ABORT modification. System agents are immutable.

## Parallel-agentmaster-execution (CRITICAL)
Run up to 5 AgentMaster instances in PARALLEL. Each AgentMaster can generate 1-3 agents per batch.
- why: Maximizes throughput. Sequential generation wastes time. Parallel = 5x faster.
- on_violation: Batch agents into groups of 3, delegate to 5 AgentMasters concurrently.

## No-interactive-questions (CRITICAL)
NO interactive questions. Fully automated gap analysis and generation.
- why: Automated workflow requires zero user prompts
- on_violation: Execute fully automated

## Brain-make-master-only (CRITICAL)
AgentMaster MUST use Bash('brain make:master') for creation - NOT Write() or Edit()
- why: Ensures proper PHP archetype structure and compilation compatibility
- on_violation: Reject manually created agents

## No-regeneration (CRITICAL)
Skip existing agents. Idempotent operation.
- why: Safe for repeated execution
- on_violation: Skip and continue

## Delegates-web-research (HIGH)
Delegate web research to WebResearchMaster. Brain NEVER executes WebSearch.
- why: Maintains delegation hierarchy
- on_violation: Delegate to WebResearchMaster


# Input
STORE-AS($RAW_INPUT = '$ARGUMENTS')
STORE-AS($INIT_PARAMS = '{initialization parameters extracted from $RAW_INPUT}')

# Phase0 arguments processing
GOAL(Process optional user arguments to narrow search scope and improve targeting)
## Examples
- STORE-AS($TARGET_DOMAIN = '{extract domain hint from $RAW_INPUT if provided}')
- Parse $RAW_INPUT for specific domain/technology/agent hints
- IF($RAW_INPUT provided) → THEN → [Extract: target_domain from $TARGET_DOMAIN (e.g., "Laravel", "React", "API"), target_technology, specific_agents → STORE-AS($SEARCH_FILTER = '{domain: $TARGET_DOMAIN, tech: ..., agents: [...], keywords: [...]}') → Set search_mode = "targeted" → Log: "Targeted mode: focusing on {domain}/{tech}"] → END-IF
- IF($RAW_INPUT empty) → THEN → [Set search_mode = "discovery" → Use full project analysis workflow → Log: "Discovery mode: full project analysis"] → END-IF
- Store search mode for use in subsequent phases

# Phase1 temporal context and web cache
GOAL(Get current date/year for temporal context AND check vector memory cache for recent patterns)
## Examples
- Bash(date +"%Y-%m-%d") → [STORE-AS($CURRENT_DATE)] → END-Bash
- Bash(date +"%Y") → [STORE-AS($CURRENT_YEAR)] → END-Bash
- PARALLEL: Check vector memory cache while temporal context loads
- mcp__vector-memory__search_memories('{query: "multi-agent architecture patterns", category: "learning", limit: 3}')
- IF(cache_hit AND cache_age < 30 days) → THEN → [STORE-AS($CACHED_PATTERNS = 'Cached industry patterns from vector memory') → STORE-AS($CACHE_VALID = 'true') → STORE-AS($CACHE_AGE = '{days}') → Log: "Using cached patterns (age: {days} days)"] → END-IF
- IF(no_cache OR cache_old) → THEN → [STORE-AS($CACHE_VALID = 'false') → Log: "Fresh web search required"] → END-IF

# Phase1.5 web search best practices

GOAL(Delegate industry best practices research to WebResearchMaster with cache awareness)
NOTE(Delegated to WebResearchMaster for industry research)

## Examples
- IF(search_mode === "discovery") → THEN → [Task(@agent-web-research-master, 'INPUT(STORE-GET($CURRENT_YEAR) && STORE-GET($CACHED_PATTERNS) && STORE-GET($CACHE_VALID) && STORE-GET($CACHE_AGE))', 'TASK → [IF(cache_valid === true) → THEN → Use cached patterns, skip web search → END-IF → IF(cache_valid === false) → THEN → [ →   Research: multi-agent system architecture best practices {year} →   Research: AI agent orchestration patterns {year} →   Research: domain-driven agent design principles {year} →   Synthesize findings into unified patterns → ] → END-IF] → END-TASK', 'OUTPUT({architecture: [...], orchestration: [...], domain_design: [...], sources: [...], cache_used: true|false})', 'STORE-AS($INDUSTRY_PATTERNS)') → IF(fresh research performed) → Store results in vector memory → mcp__vector-memory__store_memory('{content: $INDUSTRY_PATTERNS, category: "learning", tags: ["agent-patterns", "best-practices", "{CURRENT_YEAR}"]}')] → END-IF
- IF(search_mode === "targeted") → THEN → [Use $CACHED_PATTERNS from phase 1 if available → Log: "Targeted mode - using cached patterns, skipping general research"] → END-IF

# Phase2 inventory agents

GOAL(List all existing agents and separate SYSTEM agents from PROJECT agents)
NOTE(SYSTEM agents (use SystemMaster variation): AgentMaster, PromptMaster, CommitMaster, WebResearchMaster, ExploreMaster, DocumentationMaster, VectorMaster, ScriptMaster PROJECT agents (use Master variation): All other agents created for project-specific needs System agents are OFF LIMITS - only inventory, never modify or regenerate)

## Examples
- Bash('brain list:masters') Parse output
- STORE-AS($ALL_AGENTS = '[{id, name, description}, ...]')
- Filter system agents (names ending with "Master" AND in system list)
- STORE-AS($SYSTEM_AGENTS = '[AgentMaster, PromptMaster, CommitMaster, WebResearchMaster, ExploreMaster, DocumentationMaster, VectorMaster, ScriptMaster, ...]')
- Filter project agents (all others)
- STORE-AS($PROJECT_AGENTS = '[...project-specific agents...]')
- Agents located in .brain/node/Agents/*.php
- Count: system_agents = count($SYSTEM_AGENTS), project_agents = count($PROJECT_AGENTS)
- Log: "System agents (protected): {system_count}, Project agents (manageable): {project_count}"

# Phase3 read project stack
GOAL(Extract project technology stack with optional filtering based on $TARGET_DOMAIN)
## Examples
- Task(@agent-explore, 'TASK → [(IF(search_mode === "targeted") → THEN → [Priority 1: Focus exploration on $SEARCH_FILTER.domain and $SEARCH_FILTER.tech → Priority 2: Validate against project documentation (.docs/, CLAUDE.md) → Priority 3: Extract related technologies and dependencies] → END-IF + IF(search_mode === "discovery") → THEN → [Priority 1: Explore .docs/ directory if exists. Find all *.md files. → Priority 2: Extract: technologies, frameworks, services, domain requirements → Priority 3: Explore project files in ./ for tech stack (composer.json, package.json, etc.)] → END-IF + STORE-AS($PROJECT_STACK = \\'{technologies: [...], frameworks: [...], services: [...], domain_requirements: [...], primary_stack: "...", confidence: 0-1}\\'))] → END-TASK')

# Phase3.5 stack specific search

GOAL(Delegate technology-specific research to WebResearchMaster based on discovered stack)
NOTE(Delegated to WebResearchMaster for technology-specific patterns)

## Examples
- Extract primary technologies from $PROJECT_STACK (max 3 most important)
- Task(@agent-web-research-master, 'INPUT(STORE-GET($PROJECT_STACK.technologies) && STORE-GET($CURRENT_YEAR) && STORE-GET($SEARCH_FILTER) && STORE-GET($SEARCH_MODE))', 'TASK → [Extract top 3 most important technologies from stack → IF(search_mode === "targeted") → THEN → Focus on $SEARCH_FILTER tech → END-IF → FOREACH(technology in top_3_technologies) → [ →   IF(technology is major framework/language) → THEN → [ →     Research: {technology} specialized agents best practices {year} →     Research: {technology} multi-agent architecture examples {year} →     Extract: common patterns, agent types, use cases →   ] → END-IF → ] → END-FOREACH → Synthesize per-technology patterns] → END-TASK', 'OUTPUT({tech_patterns: {Laravel: [...], React: [...]}, tech_examples: {...}})', 'STORE-AS($TECH_PATTERNS)')
- Cache technology patterns in vector memory
- mcp__vector-memory__store_memory('{content: $TECH_PATTERNS, category: "learning", tags: ["tech-patterns", $PROJECT_STACK.primary_stack, "{CURRENT_YEAR}"]}')
- IF(search_mode === "targeted") → THEN → [Log: "Found {count} patterns for {$SEARCH_FILTER.tech}" → Boost relevance score for matching patterns] → END-IF

# Phase4 gap analysis enhanced

GOAL(Identify missing PROJECT-SPECIFIC agents (NOT system agents) with industry validation)
NOTE(Gap analysis compares against PROJECT_AGENTS only, not SYSTEM_AGENTS FORBIDDEN: Suggesting system agents (AgentMaster, PromptMaster, etc.) as missing New agents use Master variation, NOT SystemMaster)

## Examples
- First pass: Web-informed gap analysis for PROJECT agents
- Task(@agent-web-research-master, 'INPUT(STORE-GET($PROJECT_AGENTS) && STORE-GET($PROJECT_STACK) && STORE-GET($INDUSTRY_PATTERNS) && STORE-GET($TECH_PATTERNS) && STORE-GET($CURRENT_YEAR) && STORE-GET($SEARCH_FILTER))', 'TASK → [Gather best practices for PROJECT agent coverage (exclude system agents) → Cross-reference with industry patterns from web search → Consider technology-specific agent requirements → EXCLUDE: system agent types (orchestration, delegation, memory management) → INCLUDE: domain-specific agents (API, Cache, Auth, Payment, etc.) → IF(search_mode === "targeted") → THEN → [Focus on $SEARCH_FILTER domains only] → END-IF] → END-TASK', 'OUTPUT({covered_domains: [...], missing_agents: [{name: \\'AgentName\\', purpose: \\'...\\', capabilities: [...], industry_alignment: 0-1}], confidence: 0-1})')
- STORE-AS($WEB_GAP_ANALYSIS)
- Second pass: Deep agent-level analysis with industry validation
- Task(@agent-agent-master, 'INPUT(STORE-GET($PROJECT_AGENTS) && STORE-GET($SYSTEM_AGENTS) && STORE-GET($PROJECT_STACK) && STORE-GET($WEB_GAP_ANALYSIS) && STORE-GET($INDUSTRY_PATTERNS) && STORE-GET($TECH_PATTERNS) && STORE-GET($CURRENT_YEAR) && STORE-GET($SEARCH_FILTER))', 'TASK → [Analyze domain expertise needed based on Project requirements → Compare with existing PROJECT agents (NOT system agents) → EXCLUDE any agent that overlaps with SYSTEM_AGENTS functionality → Cross-validate against industry best practices → Validate each proposed agent against INDUSTRY_PATTERNS → Assign confidence score (0-1) to each missing agent recommendation → Prioritize critical gaps with high industry alignment → All new agents will use Master variation (NOT SystemMaster) → IF(search_mode === "targeted") → THEN → [Validate $SEARCH_FILTER.agents against project needs] → END-IF → FOREACH(missing domain) → [WebSearch({domain} agent architecture {current_year})] → END-FOREACH] → END-TASK', 'OUTPUT({covered_domains: [...], missing_agents: [{name: \\'AgentName\\', purpose: \\'...\\', capabilities: [...], confidence: 0-1, industry_alignment: 0-1, priority: "critical|high|medium", variation: "Master"}], industry_coverage_score: 0-1})', 'NOTE(Focus on PROJECT agent gaps with high confidence and industry alignment)')
- STORE-AS($GAP_ANALYSIS)
- Filter: confidence >= 0.6, industry_alignment >= 0.6, priority != "low"
- Validate: NO agent names match SYSTEM_AGENTS list
- Sort by: priority DESC, confidence DESC, industry_alignment DESC

# Phase5 parallel generation

GOAL(Create missing PROJECT agents via PARALLEL AgentMaster delegation. Max 5 concurrent AgentMasters.)
NOTE(Created agents are PROJECT agents using Master variation Created files must be valid PHP archetypes extending BrainCore\\Archetypes\\AgentArchetype FORBIDDEN: Creating any agent that matches SYSTEM_AGENTS list)

## Examples
- Step 1: Filter and batch agents
- Remove: existing agents, confidence < 0.6, priority === "low" Remove: any agent matching SYSTEM_AGENTS names (AgentMaster, PromptMaster, etc.) Keep: confidence >= 0.6 AND (priority === "critical" OR priority === "high") STORE-AS($FILTERED_AGENTS = '[...filtered project agents only...]')
- Step 2: Batch into groups of 3 (max 5 batches = 15 agents)
- batch_1 = agents[0:3], batch_2 = agents[3:6], ... STORE-AS($AGENT_BATCHES = '[[batch1], [batch2], [batch3], [batch4], [batch5]]')
- Step 3: Pre-create all agent files via brain make:master
- FOREACH(agent in $FILTERED_AGENTS) → [Bash(brain make:master {agent.name}) → [Creates .brain/node/Agents/{agent.name}.php] → END-Bash] → END-FOREACH
- Step 4: PARALLEL delegation to 5 AgentMasters
- CRITICAL: Launch ALL 5 Task() calls in SINGLE message block Each AgentMaster receives batch of 1-3 PROJECT agents to configure AgentMasters work CONCURRENTLY, not sequentially All agents use Master variation (for project agents)
- FOREACH(batch in $AGENT_BATCHES (PARALLEL)) → [Task(@agent-agent-master, 'INPUT(batch_agents = [{name, purpose, capabilities, confidence, variation: "Master"}, ...] && STORE-GET($INDUSTRY_PATTERNS) && STORE-GET($TECH_PATTERNS) && STORE-GET($PROJECT_AGENTS))', 'TASK → [FOREACH agent in batch_agents: →   1. Read created file: .brain/node/Agents/{agent.name}.php →   2. Update #[Purpose()] with detailed domain expertise →   3. Add #[Includes(Master::class)] for project agent variation →   4. Add project-specific includes from .brain/node/Includes/ →   5. Define rules + guidelines in handle() →   6. Use PHP API only (Runtime::, Operator::, Store::) → Return: {completed: [...], failed: [...]}] → END-TASK', 'OUTPUT({batch_id, completed: [names], failed: [names], errors: [...]})')] → END-FOREACH
- Step 5: Aggregate results from all AgentMasters
- Merge: all completed PROJECT agents from 5 AgentMaster responses Collect: all failures for error report STORE-AS($GENERATION_SUMMARY = '{generated: [...], failed: [...], total: N, variation: "Master"}')

# Phase6 compile
GOAL(Compile all agents to .claude/agents/)
## Examples
- Bash(brain compile) → [Compiles .brain/node/Agents/*.php to .claude/agents/] → END-Bash
- VERIFY-SUCCESS(CHECK(.claude/agents/ for new agent files) Compilation completed without errors)
- Log: "Compilation complete. New agents available in {AGENTS_FOLDER}"

# Phase7 report enhanced
GOAL(Report generation results with confidence scores, industry alignment, and caching status)
## Examples
- IF(agents_generated > 0) → THEN → [Calculate: avg_confidence = average(generated_agents.confidence) → Calculate: avg_industry_alignment = average(generated_agents.industry_alignment) → mcp__vector-memory__store_memory('{content: "Init Gap Analysis: mode={search_mode}, technologies={$PROJECT_STACK.technologies}, agents_generated={agents_count}, avg_confidence={avg_confidence}, avg_industry_alignment={avg_industry_alignment}, coverage=improved, date={$CURRENT_DATE}", category: "architecture", tags: ["init", "gap-analysis", "agents", "{CURRENT_YEAR}"]}') → OUTPUT(Generation summary with agent details, confidence scores, and industry alignment metrics)] → END-IF
- IF(agents_generated === 0) → THEN → [mcp__vector-memory__store_memory('{content: "Init Gap Analysis: mode={search_mode}, result=full_coverage, agents={agents_count}, date={$CURRENT_DATE}", category: "architecture", tags: ["init", "full-coverage", "{CURRENT_YEAR}"]}') → OUTPUT(Full coverage confirmation with existing agent list and industry coverage score)] → END-IF
- Include cache performance metrics: {cache_hits}, {web_searches_performed}

# Response format
Response structure
## Examples
- Header: Init Gap Analysis Complete | Mode: {search_mode}
- Created: .brain/node/Agents/ | Compiled: .claude/agents/
- Ready via: Task(@agent-{name} '...')
- Quality: confidence={avg}, alignment={avg}
- Performance: cache_hits={n}, parallel_batches={n}

# Error recovery
Graceful degradation
## Examples
- no .docs/ → Brain context only, continue
- agent exists → skip, log preserved
- system agent suggested → skip, log "system agent protected"
- make:master fails → skip agent, continue
- compile fails → report errors, list failed
- AgentMaster fails → skip batch, continue
- web timeout → use cached, mark partial
- no internet → local only, -0.2 confidence
- memory unavailable → skip cache, continue

# Quality gates
Validation checkpoints
## Examples
- Gate 1-3: temporal context, cache check, list:masters
- Gate 4: system vs project agents separated
- Gate 5-6: web delegation, gap analysis output
- Gate 7: NO system agents in GAP_ANALYSIS.missing_agents
- Gate 8-9: confidence >= 0.6, alignment >= 0.6
- Gate 10-11: make:master success, compile success
- Gate 12: .claude/agents/ populated with project agents

# Example parallel batch
SCENARIO(System: 8 protected (SystemMaster) | Project: 10 discovered → 4 batches → 4 parallel AgentMasters)
## Examples
- inventory: System agents (OFF LIMITS): AgentMaster, PromptMaster, CommitMaster, ExploreMaster, WebResearchMaster, DocumentationMaster, VectorMaster, ScriptMaster
- gap: 10 missing PROJECT agents: API, Cache, Queue, Auth, Payment, Report, Search, Export, Import, Sync
- variation: All new agents use Master variation (NOT SystemMaster)
- batch: batch_1=[API,Cache,Queue], batch_2=[Auth,Payment,Report], batch_3=[Search,Export], batch_4=[Import,Sync]
- parallel: Launch 4 Task(@agent-agent-master) in SINGLE message
- result: All 10 PROJECT agents created with Master variation in ~1 AgentMaster cycle

# Directive
PROJECT agents ONLY! Master variation! NEVER touch system agents! DELEGATE to AgentMaster! PARALLEL batches! brain make:master! Compile!
